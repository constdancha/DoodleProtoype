DoodlePrototype is an app that allows the user to draw on a canvas and use multiple tools
to enhance the brush or drawing space.
## Basic Functionality
The app features the basic functionality of the Doodle Prototype Specs

The brush sizes can be changed by using the different sized circles on the bottom of the screen indicating 
large, medium, and small brush size.

By using the "Color" button a alert dialog will appear that will allow the user to user rgb sliders to change the color
of the brush, and the changes will only take affect once the user selects "Ok"

The eraser icon on the bottom right corner will clear the canvas once the user draws on it again.

## Additional Functionality
The image icon button allows the user to select a photo from their library and use that as the background for the canvas.
